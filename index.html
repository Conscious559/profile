    <h1>Personal Bio</h1>

    <p> 
     I'm an enthusiastic Information Technology student currently in my third year at Vaal University of Technology, with a
        passion for web development and technology. My journey in IT has equipped me with skills
        in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, allowing me to bring creative and functional ideas
        to life. I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and enhance my problem-solving
        abilities. I am excited to make meaningful contributions in the
        tech world and continue growing my skills!
